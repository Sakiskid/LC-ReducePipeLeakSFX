No time to update this currently, as of 1/2/24

I will be back to update the manifest, readme, and picture. I will also add more sfx that can be customized.

USAGE: In the main menu, go to mod settings and turn down the valve sfx. I tested with 0 and it mutes it completely. *Make sure you click save*
